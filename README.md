## Dispensary Menu Features

WP Dispensary is packed with features to enhance the online presence of your cannabis business.

### Auto-creation of Dispensary Menu page

WP Dispensary version 2.0+ automatically creates a new "Dispensary Menu" page for you, pre-populated with each of the shortcodes that are available, giving you an instant starting point for building your menu.

See all shortcode options in the [documentation](https://www.wpdispensary.com/section/shortcodes/)

## Define your dispensary style

[CannaBiz](https://www.wpdispensary.com/product/cannabiz) is a commercial WordPress theme for the cannabis industry, built and maintained by **WP Dispensary**.

This plugin works independently of WP Dispensary, and is a perfect solution for you if you're already comfortable working with WooCommerce and don't want to learn a whole new system.
